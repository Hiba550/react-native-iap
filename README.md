## Announcement

Announcing the Migration of react-native-iap to an Expo Module for Improved Maintenance and Compatibility in [discussion #2754](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/discussions/2754). 

The [expo-iap](https://github.com/hyochan/expo-iap) library is now ready to use, with support for StoreKit 2 and Google Play Billing.

## Documentation

Read the [documentation](https://react-native-iap.hyo.dev). See the [troubleshooting](https://react-native-iap.hyo.dev/docs/guides/troubleshooting#common-issues) for the common issues to avoid.

## Logs

- Version `12.0.0`: Implements Amazon 3.x SDK including the new DRM verification.

- Version `11.0.0`: The module migrates OS sdk to [storekit2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10114). [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) is working hard on this.

  ```
  yarn add react-native-iap@next
  ```

- Version `10.0.0` is a maintenance build. Many internal refactorings and clean up of the code. Special thanks to [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) for his contributions. Most notably all methods now take an object parameter instead of separate parameters. Please help us test

- Version `9.0.0` The module migrates android sdk to [play billing library v5](https://qonversion.io/blog/google-play-billing-library-5-0). Our core maintainers [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) and [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) worked hard on this.

- Version `8.0.0` has finally landed in Jan 28th. Since this is early release, please use it with caution 🚧. We recommend user to use `>=8.0.0` with react-native `>=0.65.1`. The `next` package is no longer updated until we organize the roadmap for `9.0.0`.

- Version `8.0.0` is currently in release candidate. The module is completely rewritten with `Kotlin` and `Swift` for maintenance issue by [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) 🔆. You may install this for early preview.

- React Native IAP hook is out. You can see [medium post](https://medium.com/hyochan/announcing-react-native-iap-hooks-96c7ffd3f19a) on how to use it.

- The `react-native-iap` module hasn't been maintained well recently. We are thinking of participating again and make the module healthier. Please refer to [2021 Maintenance plan](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/issues/1241) and share with us how you or your organization is using it. Happy new year 🎉

  - The sample code is out in [crossplatformkorea/CPK/pull/12](https://github.com/crossplatformkorea/CPK/pull/12). More information in [#1241 commment](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/issues/1241#issuecomment-798540785).
